# Django Payroll System

## About the Project
### Overview
This is my final output for my Django course. The goal was to create a CRUD web app that has basic employee and payroll management functionalities. It includes specific calculations for Tax, Benefits, and Pay cycles.

### Built With
JQuery was used to handle AJAX interactions between frontend HTML files and backend Django views, enabling user interaction without necessarily doing a full page reload. 

Both jQuery and Bootstrap are included in the static directory
